Here's some coding example of my work.

CharacterBehaviour.cs and PlayerBehaviour.cs are from a game I worked on in the Spring 2019 called Rebound. If you're interested in seeing the final result, you can find the game here: https://clinealex10.itch.io/rebound

ACToolsEditorUI.cs
ACTools_UniversalStyleSheet.uss
DataManagerWindow.cs
DataManagerWindow.uxml
DataManagerWindow.uss
There scripts are from a editor exstension for Unity I'm currently working on, so it is a work in progress.


# The Javascript Test
The javascript test was a test for an internship option at BURO302, a media development teamat HAN University of Applied Sciences that does paid client work. I was accepted into BURO302 after this test.
